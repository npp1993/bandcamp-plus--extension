TODO:

implement from bandcamp extension suite:

Waveform Display
Adds a wavform display similar to visualization of Soundcloud. A toggle below the "play button" on album pages will enable/disable the display. Note: The waveform is processed browserside.


Additionally, while the generated file is a .txt, it can be run directly in terminal with the command:

. ./bandcamp_*.txt
This will download the files into the same directory the terminal session is in.
