TODO:



Additionally, while the generated file is a .txt, it can be run directly in terminal with the command:

. ./bandcamp_*.txt
This will download the files into the same directory the terminal session is in.

- unzip all downloaded .zip files in script
- implement tests with puppeteer and possibly refactor code base
- fix 'c' functionality
- implement "add all to cart" functionality



Waveform Display
